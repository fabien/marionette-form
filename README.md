Note: there's currently an overlap with some dependencies maintained in mono-client
(which is to be considered the *single source of truth*).

For use with **mono** see: mono-forms package (which is the *dist* version of this repo).

Instructions:

```
$ npm install -g serve;
$ serve -p 4444 app
```

Run the Express server for example purposes:

```
$ cd server
$ npm install;
$ node index.js (port 5000)
```
